            <h2>Basic info</h2>
            <p> <img src="Bilder/nedladdning.jpg" alt="Deacon"> Days Gone is a 2019 action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Bend Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows.

                Set in a post-apocalyptic Oregon two years after the start of a global pandemic, former outlaw-turned-drifter Deacon St. John discovers the possibility of his wife Sarah still being alive, which leads Deacon on a quest to find her. Days Gone is played from a third-person perspective, in which the player can explore an open world environment. Players can use firearms, melee weapons and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures known as Freakers. A major game mechanic is Deacon's motorcycle, which is used as the player character's primary mode of transportation as well as mobile inventory. </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="Bilder/images%20(1).jpg" alt="deacon2">Two years prior to the events of the game, the Cloverblue Corporation secretly developed a bio-weapons program disguised as a bio-botany project. Among those who unknowingly worked in the company's secret project was Sarah Whitaker, whose work was partly used in the creation of the Freaker virus. One of Whitaker's co-workers, David Gorman, was suspicious of Cloverdale's research and correctly deduced their intent. Gorman stole a sample of the virus and brought it to an environmental convention in Portland in an effort to publicly expose the company's unethical research. However, Gorman unwittingly infected himself with the stolen sample and further exposed the convention attendees, whom in turn returned to their homes all over the world and spread the virus even more. Within two weeks, the virus had spread throughout the world, killing half of the human population and turning millions of people and animals into Freakers. As a result, civilization fell, and cities were abandoned in favor of smaller settlements in the wilderness, while the world is left at the mercy of the Freakers.
